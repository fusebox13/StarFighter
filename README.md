StarFighter
===========

This is a simple OpenGL networked game that is an adaptation of the Playstation 2 game, Tempest X.  Two players sit on
opposite ends of a tunnel, and try to destroy each other.

**NOTE:** You must add the Lightweight Java Games Libary & Slick2D to the buildpath.

Below is a list of libraries needed:

* lwjgl.jar (*When added, change the native libary location for the appropriate operating system*)
* lwjgl_util.jar
* lwjgl_util_applet.jar

Found here: http://lwjgl.org/download.php

And: 

* slick.jar
